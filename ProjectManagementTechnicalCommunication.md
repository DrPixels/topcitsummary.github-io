### B) Elements of Business Communication

The process of business communication consists of several core elements that influence its effectiveness:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sender** | Initiates the communication; responsible for encoding the message. |
| **Message** | Information or idea being communicated. |
| **Encoding** | Process of converting thoughts into a communicable format. |
| **Medium** | Channel used to transmit the message (e.g., email, meeting, phone call). |
| **Receiver** | Person or group receiving the message. |
| **Decoding** | Interpreting the message by the receiver. |
| **Feedback** | Response from the receiver to confirm understanding. |
| **Noise** | Any interference that distorts the message during transmission. |

#### Importance of Feedback
- Ensures clarity and understanding.
- Helps identify and correct misinterpretations.
- Encourages engagement and responsiveness.

#### Role of Noise in Communication
- Can come from sender, medium, or receiver.
