## 01 Concept and Elements of Business Communication

### A) Definition of Business Communication

**Business communication** refers to the **systematic exchange of information** among stakeholders involved in business activities. It is essential for achieving organizational goals through effective sharing of ideas, plans, reports, and decisions.

- Involves both internal (within the company) and external (with clients, partners, regulators) interactions.
- The goal is to ensure **clarity**, **alignment**, and **actionable outcomes** across all levels of the organization.
- Key purposes include:
  - Delivering business strategies
  - Sharing progress updates
  - Resolving issues
  - Building relationships with stakeholders

Business communication occurs through various formats like meetings, emails, reports, presentations, and official documents.
