# Summary of 04 The IT Business Value Chain

## Overview

The **value chain model** is a strategic tool used to understand how businesses create value through:
- **Primary (key) activities** (e.g., production, marketing, customer service)
- **Support activities** (e.g., HR, technology, infrastructure)

It helps analyze competitive advantage and organizational structure.

---

## Key Differences: Traditional vs. E-commerce Value Chains

| Type                  | Key Activities                                 | Support Activities                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Manufacturing** | Production, logistics, marketing, sales, service | Infrastructure, HR, tech development, procurement |
| **E-commerce**        | Procurement, zero-inventory production, online sales, online services | Integrated platforms, internet recruitment, supplier management |

---

## Evolution of IT in the Value Chain

- **Pre-2000s**: IT was treated as a **back-office support function**, separate from core operations.
- **Post-2000s**: IT began integrating into **core business processes**.
- **Post-2010**: IT became central to **value creation**, especially in IT-driven companies.

---

## Integration of IT Across the Value Chain

- IT now plays a role in **every key and support activity**.
- Example: In hypermarkets, real-time inventory tracking, customer data analysis, and smart shelf placement are **IT-dependent** for competitiveness.

---

## IT-Specialized Companies

- For e-businesses like **Amazon** or **Interpark**, IT is not just a tool—it's the **foundation** of all operations.
- Traditional value chain models must be **reinterpreted** to capture this integration.

---

## Expansion of the Value Chain Concept

Two perspectives:
1. **IT integrated into existing business processes**
2. **IT as the core business itself**

This evolution leads to structural changes:
- Streamlined decision-making via intranet systems
- More **horizontal organizations** with broader access to critical information

---

## Organizational Impact

- IT transforms traditional roles and company structures.
- It’s no longer just part of the value chain—it represents a **new paradigm of value creation** that affects strategy and organization design.

> **Conclusion**: The traditional value chain model must evolve to reflect IT's central role in modern business—both as an enabler and as the foundation of new business models.
