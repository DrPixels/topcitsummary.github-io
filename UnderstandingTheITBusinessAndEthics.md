# Summary of 04 The IT Business Value Chain

## Overview

The **value chain model** is a strategic tool used to understand how businesses create value through:
- **Primary (key) activities** (e.g., production, marketing, customer service)
- **Support activities** (e.g., HR, technology, infrastructure)

It helps analyze competitive advantage and organizational structure.

---

## Key Differences: Traditional vs. E-commerce Value Chains

| Type                  | Key Activities                                 | Support Activities                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Manufacturing** | Production, logistics, marketing, sales, service | Infrastructure, HR, tech development, procurement |
| **E-commerce**        | Procurement, zero-inventory production, online sales, online services | Integrated platforms, internet recruitment, supplier management |

---

## Evolution of IT in the Value Chain

- **Pre-2000s**: IT was treated as a **back-office support function**, separate from core operations.
- **Post-2000s**: IT began integrating into **core business processes**.
- **Post-2010**: IT became central to **value creation**, especially in IT-driven companies.

---

## Integration of IT Across the Value Chain

- IT now plays a role in **every key and support activity**.
- Example: In hypermarkets, real-time inventory tracking, customer data analysis, and smart shelf placement are **IT-dependent** for competitiveness.

---

## IT-Specialized Companies

- For e-businesses like **Amazon** or **Interpark**, IT is not just a tool—it's the **foundation** of all operations.
- Traditional value chain models must be **reinterpreted** to capture this integration.

---

## Expansion of the Value Chain Concept

Two perspectives:
1. **IT integrated into existing business processes**
2. **IT as the core business itself**

This evolution leads to structural changes:
- Streamlined decision-making via intranet systems
- More **horizontal organizations** with broader access to critical information

---

## Organizational Impact

- IT transforms traditional roles and company structures.
- It’s no longer just part of the value chain—it represents a **new paradigm of value creation** that affects strategy and organization design.

> **Conclusion**: The traditional value chain model must evolve to reflect IT's central role in modern business—both as an enabler and as the foundation of new business models.

### A) Understanding BPR (Business Process Reengineering)

**Concept of BPR**  
Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is a technique for **radically redesigning business processes** to achieve significant improvements in performance indicators such as cost, quality, service, and speed. Introduced by Professor Michael Hammer in 1990, BPR aims to resolve inefficiencies in existing business processes through **process-centric thinking**, rather than focusing on jobs, workers, or organizational structures.

#### Four Key Attributes of BPR:

| Attribute | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Basic** | BPR addresses the fundamental problems within an enterprise. It asks questions like: What is the purpose of the task? What are the current problems? What inefficient elements exist in operations? |
| **Zero Base** | BPR involves designing new ways of performing tasks by completely abandoning outdated procedures and starting from scratch. |
| **Dramatic Improvement** | BPR is used when **radical innovation** is needed. It focuses on achieving major improvements rather than incremental changes. |
| **Process** | The main focus of BPR is on **business processes**, aiming to optimize the workflows that drive business value without being constrained by existing roles or structures. |

These attributes make BPR a powerful tool for transforming organizations, especially when they face declining competitiveness due to outdated or inefficient internal processes.

### B) Understanding PI (Process Innovation)

**Process Innovation (PI)** refers to the continuous enhancement of business processes within an existing framework.

- Involves identifying bottlenecks, redesigning workflows, and integrating new technologies.
- Example: A public organization improved its service delivery by simplifying procedures and removing redundant steps.

PI often complements ERP adoption by aligning business processes with system capabilities.

### C) Understanding Six Sigma

**Six Sigma** is a data-driven methodology aimed at reducing defects and variability in business processes to near-perfect quality. Originating from Motorola in 1987, it focuses on achieving less than 3.4 defects per million opportunities.

#### Key Characteristics of Six Sigma:
- **Statistical measurement** is central to identifying inefficiencies.
- It is an **enterprise-wide initiative**, not limited to specific departments.
- Aims to enhance **customer satisfaction** by improving process outputs.
- Promotes a culture of **continuous improvement** across the organization.

#### Six Sigma Hierarchy:

| Role              | Qualifications                                                                 | Key Responsibilities |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Champion**       | Senior executive with leadership experience                                     | Provides vision, secures resources, oversees implementation |
| **Master Black Belt** | Extensive practical experience and deep knowledge of Six Sigma methodologies    | Trains and mentors Black Belts and Green Belts; advises on project selection |
| **Black Belt**     | Manager-level employees skilled in statistics and Six Sigma tools               | Leads complex Six Sigma projects; trains Green Belts |
| **Green Belt**     | Employees with job-specific knowledge and basic training in Six Sigma techniques| Participates in projects; applies Six Sigma tools to localized improvements |

#### Six Sigma Implementation Methodologies:

There are two primary approaches based on the nature of the project:

| Program Type        | Methodology | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Design Program**   | **DMADV** (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify) | Used for designing new processes or products to meet customer expectations and prevent defects from the outset. |
| **Manufacturing Program** | **DMAIC** (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) | Applied to existing processes to reduce defects and prevent recurrence through structured improvement. |

These methodologies ensure that Six Sigma initiatives are executed systematically, whether the goal is to create new, high-quality processes or refine existing ones.

### E) Understanding SERVQUAL

**SERVQUAL** is a model for measuring and improving service quality based on five dimensions:
1. **Tangibles**
2. **Reliability**
3. **Responsiveness**
4. **Assurance**
5. **Empathy**

It helps businesses identify gaps between customer expectations and actual service delivery, guiding targeted improvements.

### F) Understanding SPC (Statistical Process Control)

**SPC** uses statistical methods to monitor and control business processes.

- Helps detect variations early and maintain process stability.
- Commonly applied in manufacturing and service sectors to ensure consistent output quality.

SPC relies on control charts and real-time data analysis to prevent defects before they occur.
