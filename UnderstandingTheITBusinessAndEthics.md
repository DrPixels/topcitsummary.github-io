# Summary of 04 The IT Business Value Chain

## Overview

The **value chain model** is a strategic tool used to understand how businesses create value through:
- **Primary (key) activities** (e.g., production, marketing, customer service)
- **Support activities** (e.g., HR, technology, infrastructure)

It helps analyze competitive advantage and organizational structure.

## Key Differences: Traditional vs. E-commerce Value Chains

| Type                  | Key Activities                                 | Support Activities                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Manufacturing** | Production, logistics, marketing, sales, service | Infrastructure, HR, tech development, procurement |
| **E-commerce**        | Procurement, zero-inventory production, online sales, online services | Integrated platforms, internet recruitment, supplier management |

---

## Evolution of IT in the Value Chain

- **Pre-2000s**: IT was treated as a **back-office support function**, separate from core operations.
- **Post-2000s**: IT began integrating into **core business processes**.
- **Post-2010**: IT became central to **value creation**, especially in IT-driven companies.

---

## Integration of IT Across the Value Chain

- IT now plays a role in **every key and support activity**.
- Example: In hypermarkets, real-time inventory tracking, customer data analysis, and smart shelf placement are **IT-dependent** for competitiveness.

---

## IT-Specialized Companies

- For e-businesses like **Amazon** or **Interpark**, IT is not just a tool—it's the **foundation** of all operations.
- Traditional value chain models must be **reinterpreted** to capture this integration.

---

## Expansion of the Value Chain Concept

Two perspectives:
1. **IT integrated into existing business processes**
2. **IT as the core business itself**

This evolution leads to structural changes:
- Streamlined decision-making via intranet systems
- More **horizontal organizations** with broader access to critical information

---

## Organizational Impact

- IT transforms traditional roles and company structures.
- It’s no longer just part of the value chain—it represents a **new paradigm of value creation** that affects strategy and organization design.

> **Conclusion**: The traditional value chain model must evolve to reflect IT's central role in modern business—both as an enabler and as the foundation of new business models.

## 01 Summary of Lessons Learned

The **IT business strategy phase** is divided into two main parts:

1. **Establishment of an IT Business Strategy**
   - Involves defining the strategic direction of the organization.
   - Includes understanding strategic concepts, core elements (mission, vision, goals), and the overall strategy-setting process.

2. **Analysis of the IT Business Environment**
   - Covers both external and internal environments.
   - Utilizes analytical tools like PEST, Porter’s Five Forces, 3C/4P, McKinsey 7S, SWOT, and BCG Matrix to assess opportunities, threats, strengths, and weaknesses.

This structured approach ensures that strategies are aligned with both organizational objectives and environmental realities, enabling companies to adapt and remain competitive in a dynamic IT landscape.

---

## 02 Establishment of an IT Business Strategy

### A) The Concept of Strategy Establishment

- **Strategy establishment** is the process of defining actions to fulfill an organization's mission.
- Strategic plans must align with unit-level strategies and provide direction for enterprise architecture, risk management, and portfolio management.
- Strategies should be updated continuously to reflect evolving IT business environments.

### B) Elements of a Strategy Plan

A comprehensive strategy plan includes the following key components:

| Element             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Mission**         | Core purpose or main business; time-independent. |
| **Vision**          | Ideal future state achieved through mission fulfillment. |
| **Goals/Objectives** | Measurable targets aligned with mission and vision. |
| **Principles**      | Constraints and values guiding decision-making. |

| **Strategic Plan**  | Document outlining strategy and its influencing factors. |
| **Initiatives & Actions** | Specific tasks and procedures for implementation. |
| **Performance Index** | Metrics used to measure goal achievement. |

These elements guide transformation from the current (AS-IS) model to the desired future (To-Be) model.

### C) Strategy Setting Process

The strategy formulation process follows four major stages:

1. **Strategy Analysis**
   - Collects data on internal and external environments.
   - Internal environment can be controlled and improved; external requires adaptation.
   - Includes:
     - **External analysis**: Macro (PEST) and micro (Porter’s Five Forces).
     - **Internal analysis**: McKinsey 7S.
     - **Consolidated analysis**: SWOT.

2. **Strategy Selection**
   - Evaluates alternatives based on thorough analysis.
   - Selects the most viable strategic direction using predefined criteria.

3. **Strategy Implementation and Management**
   - Executes the chosen strategy while managing change, resource allocation, and stakeholder engagement.
   - Progress is monitored and fed back into the analysis phase for continuous improvement.

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Ensures strategies remain valid amid changing conditions.
   - Adjustments are made as needed to maintain alignment with business goals.

# Summary of Chapter III: Understanding IT Business Planning: Recent Trends and Key Issues

---

## 01 Summary of Lessons Learned

IT business planning begins with **strategy establishment** and extends into **planning**, specifically through two major activities:
- **Enterprise Architecture (EA)** – a macro-level blueprint for aligning business and IT.
- **Information Strategic Planning (ISP)** – more detailed, system-specific planning.

These plans guide the deployment, operation, and evaluation of IT business processes and services. Effective planning prevents redundant or overlapping development efforts and ensures alignment with organizational goals.

Key to this process is **IT governance**, which provides control over EA and ISP implementation, ensuring alignment with corporate strategy, managing risk, and measuring performance.

## 03 Concept of EA (Enterprise Architecture)

### A) Overview of EA

- **Definition**: Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a blueprint that explains how IT supports enterprise strategy and information resource management.
- Used to define the current and desired future state of the relationship between IT and business.
- Helps stakeholders understand the big picture of business and IT operations.

> As defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), EA enables enterprises to achieve strategic goals through structured IT-business alignment.

### B) Conceptual Diagram of an EA and Its Components

- **EA starts with enterprise business strategy**, which converges with IT strategy to produce a unified architecture.
- **Components of EA**:
  - **Business Architecture (BA)** – Organizing business processes and functions.
  - **Application Architecture (AA)** – Structure of applications supporting business needs.
  - **Data Architecture (DA)** – Management of data assets.
  - **Technology Architecture (TA)** – Underlying tech infrastructure.
  - **Security Architecture (SA)** – Integrated security controls.
  - **Standard Profile (SP)** – Detailed specifications of technology standards.

Each component has reference models (e.g., PRM, DRM, TRM) that provide industry best practices and government-wide EA templates.

### C) The EA Framework

Popular EA frameworks include:

| Framework              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Zachman Framework**  | Most widely used; based on a matrix of perspectives (Planner, Owner, Designer, etc.) and descriptive aspects (Data, Function, Network, etc.). |
| **TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)** | Open framework focusing on interoperability; includes ADM cycle, TRM, and SIP. |
| **FEAF (Federal EA Framework)** | Developed by U.S. CIO Council; defines five reference models (BRM, PRM, DRM, SRM, TRM) and uses Zachman as a foundation. |

These frameworks help in structuring EA, identifying gaps (AS-IS vs. TO-BE), and guiding implementation.
