# Summary of 04 The IT Business Value Chain

## Overview

The **value chain model** is a strategic tool used to understand how businesses create value through:
- **Primary (key) activities** (e.g., production, marketing, customer service)
- **Support activities** (e.g., HR, technology, infrastructure)

It helps analyze competitive advantage and organizational structure.

## Key Differences: Traditional vs. E-commerce Value Chains

| Type                  | Key Activities                                 | Support Activities                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Manufacturing** | Production, logistics, marketing, sales, service | Infrastructure, HR, tech development, procurement |
| **E-commerce**        | Procurement, zero-inventory production, online sales, online services | Integrated platforms, internet recruitment, supplier management |

## Evolution of IT in the Value Chain

- **Pre-2000s**: IT was treated as a **back-office support function**, separate from core operations.
- **Post-2000s**: IT began integrating into **core business processes**.
- **Post-2010**: IT became central to **value creation**, especially in IT-driven companies.

---

## Integration of IT Across the Value Chain

- IT now plays a role in **every key and support activity**.
- Example: In hypermarkets, real-time inventory tracking, customer data analysis, and smart shelf placement are **IT-dependent** for competitiveness.

---

## IT-Specialized Companies

- For e-businesses like **Amazon** or **Interpark**, IT is not just a tool—it's the **foundation** of all operations.
- Traditional value chain models must be **reinterpreted** to capture this integration.

---

## Expansion of the Value Chain Concept

Two perspectives:
1. **IT integrated into existing business processes**
2. **IT as the core business itself**

This evolution leads to structural changes:
- Streamlined decision-making via intranet systems
- More **horizontal organizations** with broader access to critical information

---

## Organizational Impact

- IT transforms traditional roles and company structures.
- It’s no longer just part of the value chain—it represents a **new paradigm of value creation** that affects strategy and organization design.

> **Conclusion**: The traditional value chain model must evolve to reflect IT's central role in modern business—both as an enabler and as the foundation of new business models.

# Summary of Chapter II: IT Business Strategy: Recent Trends and Major Issues

## Overview

The development of an **IT business strategy** involves aligning IT with core business processes to achieve organizational goals. As IT becomes more integrated into business operations, strategic planning must evolve to reflect this convergence. This section discusses the components of strategy formulation, environmental analysis techniques (like SWOT, PEST, Porter’s Five Forces), and how they contribute to competitive advantage.

## Key Elements of IT Business Strategy

### A) Strategy Formulation Process
1. **Strategy Analysis**: Understand internal and external environments.
2. **Strategy Selection**: Choose the best future direction based on analysis.
3. **Implementation & Management**: Execute the strategy and monitor progress.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Reassess strategy in response to changing conditions.

### B) Core Components of a Strategy Plan
- **Mission**: The company's fundamental purpose.
- **Vision**: Long-term aspiration driven by mission fulfillment.
- **Goals/Objectives**: Measurable targets aligned with mission and vision.
- **Principles**: Constraints and values guiding decision-making.

## IT Business Environment Analysis

### A) External Environment Analysis

#### 1. **PEST Analysis**
Analyzes macro-environmental factors:
- **Political**: Government stability, regulations, tax policies.
- **Economic**: Growth, unemployment, inflation, income distribution.
- **Social/Cultural**: Demographics, education, cultural norms.
- **Technological**: Innovation, internet impact, R&D trends.

> *Note:* Sometimes expanded to **PESTLE/PESTEL** with Legal and Environmental factors.

#### 2. **Porter’s Five Forces**
Micro-environmental framework to assess industry competitiveness:
- **Competitive Rivalry**: Degree of competition in the industry.
- **Supplier Power**: Influence suppliers have over pricing and availability.
- **Buyer Power**: Influence buyers have over price and terms.
- **Threat of New Entrants**: Ease of new competitors entering the market.
- **Threat of Substitutes**: Availability of alternative products/services.

#### 3. **3C & 4P Analysis**
- **3C**: Customer, Company, Competitor analysis.
- **4P**: Product, Price, Place, Promotion strategies.

### B) Internal Environment Analysis

#### **McKinsey 7S Framework**
Used to evaluate internal alignment across seven elements:
1. **Shared Values**
2. **Strategy**
3. **Structure**
4. **Systems**
5. **Skills**
6. **Staff**
7. **Style**

These elements are interdependent; misalignment can lead to inefficiencies and poor performance.

---

### C) Consolidated Environment Analysis

#### **SWOT Analysis**
A matrix-based approach to identify:
- **Strengths (S)** – Internal advantages.
- **Weaknesses (W)** – Internal limitations.
- **Opportunities (O)** – External favorable conditions.
- **Threats (T)** – External challenges.

##### Strategic Directions from SWOT:
| Quadrant | Strategy Type       | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| S + O    | **SO Strategy**     | Leverage strengths to exploit opportunities. |
| S + T    | **ST Strategy**     | Use strengths to avoid or reduce threats. |
| W + O    | **WO Strategy**     | Overcome weaknesses by leveraging opportunities. |
| W + T    | **WT Strategy**     | Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats. |

> *Modern Note:* With increased use of **business intelligence**, SWOT analysis is becoming more data-driven and predictive, improving its strategic value.

#### **BCG Matrix**
Tool for evaluating product/business portfolios using:
- **Market Growth Rate** (Y-axis)
- **Relative Market Share** (X-axis)

Quadrants:
1. **Stars**: High growth, high share – invest.
2. **Cash Cows**: Low growth, high share – generate cash.
3. **Question Marks**: High growth, low share – risky investments.
4. **Dogs**: Low growth, low share – consider divesting.
