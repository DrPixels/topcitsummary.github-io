# Summary of 04 The IT Business Value Chain

## Overview

The **value chain model** is a strategic tool used to understand how businesses create value through:
- **Primary (key) activities** (e.g., production, marketing, customer service)
- **Support activities** (e.g., HR, technology, infrastructure)

It helps analyze competitive advantage and organizational structure.

## Key Differences: Traditional vs. E-commerce Value Chains

| Type                  | Key Activities                                 | Support Activities                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Manufacturing** | Production, logistics, marketing, sales, service | Infrastructure, HR, tech development, procurement |
| **E-commerce**        | Procurement, zero-inventory production, online sales, online services | Integrated platforms, internet recruitment, supplier management |

---

## Evolution of IT in the Value Chain

- **Pre-2000s**: IT was treated as a **back-office support function**, separate from core operations.
- **Post-2000s**: IT began integrating into **core business processes**.
- **Post-2010**: IT became central to **value creation**, especially in IT-driven companies.

---

## Integration of IT Across the Value Chain

- IT now plays a role in **every key and support activity**.
- Example: In hypermarkets, real-time inventory tracking, customer data analysis, and smart shelf placement are **IT-dependent** for competitiveness.

---

## IT-Specialized Companies

- For e-businesses like **Amazon** or **Interpark**, IT is not just a tool—it's the **foundation** of all operations.
- Traditional value chain models must be **reinterpreted** to capture this integration.

---

## Expansion of the Value Chain Concept

Two perspectives:
1. **IT integrated into existing business processes**
2. **IT as the core business itself**

This evolution leads to structural changes:
- Streamlined decision-making via intranet systems
- More **horizontal organizations** with broader access to critical information

---

## Organizational Impact

- IT transforms traditional roles and company structures.
- It’s no longer just part of the value chain—it represents a **new paradigm of value creation** that affects strategy and organization design.

> **Conclusion**: The traditional value chain model must evolve to reflect IT's central role in modern business—both as an enabler and as the foundation of new business models.

## 01 Summary of Lessons Learned

The **IT business strategy phase** is divided into two main parts:

1. **Establishment of an IT Business Strategy**
   - Involves defining the strategic direction of the organization.
   - Includes understanding strategic concepts, core elements (mission, vision, goals), and the overall strategy-setting process.

2. **Analysis of the IT Business Environment**
   - Covers both external and internal environments.
   - Utilizes analytical tools like PEST, Porter’s Five Forces, 3C/4P, McKinsey 7S, SWOT, and BCG Matrix to assess opportunities, threats, strengths, and weaknesses.

This structured approach ensures that strategies are aligned with both organizational objectives and environmental realities, enabling companies to adapt and remain competitive in a dynamic IT landscape.

## 02 Establishment of an IT Business Strategy

### A) The Concept of Strategy Establishment

- **Strategy establishment** is the process of defining actions to fulfill an organization's mission.
- Strategic plans must align with unit-level strategies and provide direction for enterprise architecture, risk management, and portfolio management.
- Strategies should be updated continuously to reflect evolving IT business environments.

### B) Elements of a Strategy Plan

A comprehensive strategy plan includes the following key components:

| Element             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Mission**         | Core purpose or main business; time-independent. |
| **Vision**          | Ideal future state achieved through mission fulfillment. |
| **Goals/Objectives** | Measurable targets aligned with mission and vision. |
| **Principles**      | Constraints and values guiding decision-making. |
| **Enablers/Barriers** | External/internal factors influencing success. |
| **Strategy**        | Approach to achieving goals within defined constraints. |
| **Strategic Plan**  | Document outlining strategy and its influencing factors. |
| **Initiatives & Actions** | Specific tasks and procedures for implementation. |
| **Performance Index** | Metrics used to measure goal achievement. |

These elements guide transformation from the current (AS-IS) model to the desired future (To-Be) model.

### C) Strategy Setting Process

The strategy formulation process follows four major stages:

1. **Strategy Analysis**
   - Collects data on internal and external environments.
   - Internal environment can be controlled and improved; external requires adaptation.
   - Includes:
     - **External analysis**: Macro (PEST) and micro (Porter’s Five Forces).
     - **Internal analysis**: McKinsey 7S.
     - **Consolidated analysis**: SWOT.

2. **Strategy Selection**
   - Evaluates alternatives based on thorough analysis.
   - Selects the most viable strategic direction using predefined criteria.

3. **Strategy Implementation and Management**
   - Executes the chosen strategy while managing change, resource allocation, and stakeholder engagement.
   - Progress is monitored and fed back into the analysis phase for continuous improvement.

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Ensures strategies remain valid amid changing conditions.
   - Adjustments are made as needed to maintain alignment with business goals.

## 03 IT Business Environment Analysis

### A) External Environment Analysis

#### 1. **PEST Analysis**

Used to evaluate **macro-environmental** factors:

| Category              | Example Factors |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Political (P)**     | Government stability, regulations, tax policy |
| **Economic (E)**      | Growth rate, inflation, income distribution |
| **Social/Cultural (S)** | Demographics, education, social mobility |
| **Technological (T)** | Internet impact, R&D trends, communication costs |

> *Note:* Expanded versions include Legal (L) and Environmental (E) factors, forming **PESTLE/PESTEL**.

#### 2. **Porter’s Five Forces Framework**

Analyzes **micro-environmental** industry structure:

1. **Competitive Rivalry**
2. **Supplier Power**
3. **Buyer Power**
4. **Threat of New Entrants**
5. **Threat of Substitutes**

This model helps identify competitive pressures and develop responses to strengthen market position.

#### 3. **3C & 4P Analysis**

- **3C**: 
  - **Customer**: Market size, demand hierarchy.
  - **Company**: Internal/external strengths/weaknesses.
  - **Competition**: Competitor identification and benchmarking.

- **4P** (Marketing Mix):
  - **Product**: Design, quality, brand.
  - **Price**: Pricing strategy, competitor comparison.
  - **Place**: Distribution channels, logistics.
  - **Promotion**: Advertising, customer engagement.

### B) Internal Environment Analysis

#### **McKinsey 7S Framework**

Analyzes internal dynamics using seven interrelated elements:

1. **Shared Values** – Organizational culture and core beliefs.
2. **Strategy** – Direction and goals.
3. **Structure** – Organizational design and roles.
4. **Systems** – Processes and procedures.
5. **Staff** – Capabilities and expertise of employees.
6. **Style** – Leadership and management practices.
7. **Skills** – Core competencies of the organization.

Misalignment among these elements can lead to inefficiencies, so comprehensive management is essential.

### C) Consolidated Internal and External Environment Analysis

#### **SWOT Analysis**

A matrix-based framework that combines internal and external factors:

| Quadrant | Strategy Type       | Focus |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| S + O    | **SO Strategy**     | Use strengths to exploit opportunities. |
| S + T    | **ST Strategy**     | Use strengths to mitigate threats. |
| W + O    | **WO Strategy**     | Overcome weaknesses by leveraging opportunities. |
| W + T    | **WT Strategy**     | Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats. |

- Originally used for marketing strategy but now widely applied across corporate strategy planning.
- With **business intelligence**, SWOT has evolved into a data-driven, predictive tool, improving strategic accuracy and execution.

#### **BCG Matrix**

Tool for evaluating product/business portfolios:

| Quadrant     | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Stars**    | High growth, high market share – invest. |
| **Cash Cows** | Low growth, high share – generate cash. |
| **Question Marks** | High growth, low share – risky investments. |
| **Dogs**     | Low growth, low share – consider divesting. |

Helps prioritize investments and manage resources effectively.
